## Hello developer!

Welcome to Chat Application Project on Codedamn. This is one of the many projects available on [codedamn](https://codedamn.com/projects) to reinforce your learning by building. If you want to become a full stack developer and learn by practicing, feel free to attempt this challenge. Feel free to check out the codedamn [Full Stack Web Development Learning Path](https://codedamn.com/learning-paths/fullstack) to learn more about how to become an awesome full stack developer.

## Project Overview

You have to implement chat application where users can 


### Landing Page

The landing page is similar to that of the register page, so we don't need another landing page for this project

### Register

THe registration functionality should be implemented at  `/register` route.

This should contain the students details, refer to the student document for the details to be collected.

### Log In

The login functionality should be implemented in the `/login` route.

## API Routes 

### `/api/auth/login`

To verify the user credentials on Sign In, taking the parameters as the roll number and the password 

### `/api/auth/register` 

To register a new student and add the document to the database

### `/api/messages` 

 To get the previous messages in the conversation. Make sure to pass in the Conversation ID to retrieve the messages 

 ### `/api/conversations`

 To list out all the open conversations on the chat application. 


### MongoDB User document
```
{ 
    "username" : string,
    "email" : string,
    "password" : string
}
```

### MongoDB Message document
```
{
    "conversationId" : string,
    "sender" : string, 
    "message" : string
}
```
Take a look at the mongoose schema to get the perfect Idea. 

### MongoDb Conversation document
```
{
    "conversationId" : string,
    "members" : array
}
```

### Ports 
The Codedamn Playgrounds exposes only `1337` and `1338` ports on the internet. So you'll be using `localhost` for connecting to the mongodb instance as they are hosted on the same docker container. You can specify it as `localhost:27017` or simple write `localhost`. 

You have to use the `1338` port for the web socket connection. 

You are free to use any third party libraries for the web sockets or any other part of the application. 

To understand about web sockets, you can refer to this [blog](https://codedamn.com/news/backend/what-are-web-sockets-how-is-it-different-from-http)
## Recommended Technologies 

1. Mongoose for mongodb object modelling and effective type system 
1. Tailwind CSS for User Interface
